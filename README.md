####OVERVIEW

There is nothing better than the smooth texture and rich taste of a piece of chocolate. Almost everyone is a huge fan of this delicacy made out of Theobroma cacao seeds, roasted and ground. 
However, not all chocolates are same!
This dataset contains expert ratings of over 1,700 individual chocolate bars, along with information on their regional origin, percentage of cocoa, the variety of chocolate bean used and where the beans were grown (kaggle.com).
